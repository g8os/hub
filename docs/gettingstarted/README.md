# Getting Started with the Zero-OS Hub

It is recommended to first learn about 0-fs, as documented in the [0-fs](https://github.com/zero-os/0-fs/blob/master/docs/README.md) documentation, and then about creating flists, as documented in [Creating Flists](https://github.com/zero-os/0-fs/blob/master/docs/flists/creating.md).

Then see the [Create a Flist and Start a Container](https://github.com/zero-os/home/blob/master/docs/tutorials/Create_a_Flist_and_Start_a_Container.md) tutorial for an example on how to use the Zero-OS Hub.
