# Zero-OS Hub

Containers boot from flist files, containing only metadata about the actual container image files. The files will be downloaded from the Zero-OS Hub when needed.

The Zero-OS Hub is where all container images files are stored. The official Zero-OS Hub is active on https://hub.gig.tech/, here you find all flists shared by the Zero-OS community.
See for instance the Ubuntu 16.04 flist of Ubuntu 16.04: https://hub.gig.tech/gig-official-apps/ubuntu1604.flist

Setting up your own (private) Zero-OS Hub is also supported, documented on [`INSTALL.md`](INSTALL.md) file
